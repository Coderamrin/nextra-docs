# Getting the Stripe Secret Key

To get the Stripe secret key you have to have a Stripe account. If you donâ€™t have one go ahead and create it.

For this integration, we are using the Test Mode. Before you deploy your site, make sure to Activate your Stripe account and integrate it with a real Secret Key.

1. Go to the **Developers** tab.

2. Then go to the **API Keys** tab, after that scroll down to the **Secret Key** and copy it.

Now add it to the .env file.

```bash copy
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```
