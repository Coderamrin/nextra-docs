# NextAuth Setup

For authentication, we are using NextAuth. 

Before integrating Github and Google authentication you have to set up NextAuth. 

To set up NextAuth, first, create a **.env** file in the root of your project.  

Then add NextAuth_SECRET and NextAuth_CLIENT to the **.env** file. 

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=SECRET_KEY
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

NEXTAUTH_SECRET is just a random string. You can generate a random string using this command

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or you can go to [this](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) URL it’ll give you a unique string too. 

The NEXTAUTH_URL for development is http://localhost:3000 and for deployment it’s the canonical URL of your site.
