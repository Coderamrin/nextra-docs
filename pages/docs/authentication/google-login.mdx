# Google Login

In this part of the documentation, we are going to show you how you can integrate Google Authentication into the Next.js Template.

To integrate Google Authentication you have to create a project on Google Console. Then you have to get the Secret and Client Key.

Follow these steps to create a project on Google Console, after that get the Secret and Client ID.

### Getting The Google Secret and Client ID

To get the Google Secret go to **[Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).** If you already have projects you’ll see **CREATE CREDENTIALS** button at the top, from there you can generate the Secret and Client ID.

If you don’t have a project already then create one.

1. Create a Project: Go to the Projects tab, you’ll see all the projects there.

2. After that click on the **New Project** button as shown below, then follow the steps to create a new project.

3. Once you’ve created the project make sure to select it.

4. Now create the credentials by clicking on the **CREATE CREDENTIALS** and then the **0Auth client id.**

5. Once you click on the **0Auth client ID** you might see something like this. If you see this, go ahead and configure the consent screen.

6. Once it’s done click on the **0Auth client ID** once again and follow the steps to set it up

7. You’ll be asked to provide the **Authorized JavaScript Origin.** Click on the **ADD URI** button to add it.

Since we are setting up a local environment, we are going to add our [localhost](http://localhost) URI there.

8. After that, you have to provide the **Authorized redirects URI.** For the **Authorized redirects URI** you have to include your domain with the callback path included in the end.

For production: `https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/api/auth/callback/google`

For development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

9. Once the setup is done click on the **Create** button, if everything is done perfectly you’ll be redirected to this page.

Here you can see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** go ahead and copy-paste them to the .env file

![google-login](https://nextjstemplates.com/docs/google-login8.png)

The .env variables will look like this:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_SECRET
```

If you’ve accidentally closed the tab, click on this button to open it again.
