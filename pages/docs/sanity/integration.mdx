4. Get the key from the project: To get the key login to [Sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and then go to the project you want to connect. When you go to the project, you’ll see **Project ID** under the Project name as shown below. Go ahead and copy it.

5. Now add this Project ID to the .env file, to the following variable:

```bash
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

6. Now, add the following data to the **Sanity.config.ts** file. We need the **TItle**, **ProjectID,** and **Dataset** of the project.

You can find the **Sanity.config.ts** file on the root of the template.
