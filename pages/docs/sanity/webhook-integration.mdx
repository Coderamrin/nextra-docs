# Sanity Webhook Integration

Sanity webhook is used for on-demand data revalidation.
In this part of the documentation, we will show you how to integrate a **Sanity** webhook into your project.

Follow the steps to integrate webhook:

1. Create a webhook: Go to [sanity/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and navigate to the API tab then click on the **Create Webhook** button

2. Fill in the form with information about the hook you want to create:

**Name:** Give your webhook a name.

**Description:** Describe the function of your webhook (This is an optional field).

**URL:** Set the URL to https://YOUR_SITE_URL/api/revalidate

**Dataset:** Choose your desired dataset or leave the default value.

**Trigger on:** Set the hook to trigger on **"Create"**, **"Update"**, and **"Delete"**.

**Filter:** Leave this field blank.

**Projections:** Set the projections to **`{_type, "slug":` `slug.current}`**

**Status:** Check the enable webhook box.

**HTTP Method:** POST.

Leave HTTP headers, API version, and Draft as default.

**Secret:** Give your webhook a unique secret and copy it.

Hit save once completed to create your webhook.

3. Save your webhook in the .env file under this variable name of your live site.

Note: you can’t test webhook in the dev environment.

```
SANITY_HOOK_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
```

4. Testing the webhook: If you deployed your site on Vercel then you can see the API call on the log if you choose the post method.
