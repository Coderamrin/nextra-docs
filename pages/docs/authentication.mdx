# Authentication

In this part of the documentation we are going to show you how to configure NextAuth and enable Authentication.

First setup [Database](/docs/database) & [NextAuth](/docs/authentication/nextAuth-setup) then follow any of the method you want:

-   [Google Authentication](/docs/authentication/google-login)
-   [Github Authentication](/docs/authentication/github-login)

<Callout>
	**Note**: We only showed you how to integrate Google and GitHub authentication. If you want, you can
	integrate other providers too. Checkout the [NextAuth documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) for more
	information.
