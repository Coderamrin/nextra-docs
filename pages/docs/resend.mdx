# Resend Integration

In this part of the documentation, we will show you how to integrate SMTP to be able to send transactional mail from your website. 

Follow the steps below to integrate SMTP in your boilerplate template:

<Callout type="info">
Note: We will be using **Resend** as our SMTP provider. You can use any SMTP provider you want. 
</Callout>

1. Login to **[Resend](https://resend.com/)** if you donâ€™t have an account already go ahead and create one. 
2. **Generate API Key:** Go to **API Keys** and click on the **Create API Key** button

3. Get the SMTP **PORT** and **HOST:** Go to **Settings** then go to **SMTP** you can see all of them here.

Go ahead and copy these and then update the env file

```shellscript copy
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=YOUR_SMTP_HOST
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=YOUR_SMTP_PORT
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=YOUR_SMTP_USER
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD(for resend it's the API KEY)
EMAIL_FROM=YOUR_EMAIL_TO_SEND_FROM
```

One last thing you have to do is verify your [Domain](https://resend.com/domains).
