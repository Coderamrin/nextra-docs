For email Authentication we used a Database with Prisma ORM.

In this part of the documentation we are going to show you how to integrate a database on your boilerplate template. 

We will show you how to integrate Vercel PostgreSQL if you want to use other providers you can do so.

Follow the providers documentation and generate the Database URL and update the env variable.
