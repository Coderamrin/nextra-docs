# PostgreSQL

Our boilerplate templates comes with PostgreSQL integration.
In this part of the documentation, we are going to show you how to integrate Vercel Postgres with your boilerplate template. 

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** If you want to use other [providers](/docs/database#other-providers) you can do so. For demonstration purpose we are using [Vercel PostgreSQL](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres)
</Callout>

### Getting the Database URL

Before we integrate the database in the template first you have to [deploy](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy) it to Vercel. 

Once you deploy it follow the instruction to create the database. 

1. Go to the **Storage** tab.

2. Now Scroll down and click on the **Create New Database** button.

After that select **Postgres** and then the **Continue** button.

Now do the following to create a new database: 

3. Enter the database name. The name can only contain alphanumeric letters, "_" and "-" and can't exceed 32 characters.
4. Select a region. 
5. Click **Create.** 

The Database is created successfully.

Because we created the database in a project, we won’t have to add the environment variables manually to Vercel. It’ll be added automatically. 

Now we have to pull the environment variables to the local project. 

To do that, first of all, you have to install **Vercel CLI**

```bash
npm i -g vercel@latest
```

After that run this command to pull the .env variables. 

```bash
vercel env pull .env
```

**Note**: You have to connect the local project with Vercel for this command to work. Follow this [instruction](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) to link the project.
